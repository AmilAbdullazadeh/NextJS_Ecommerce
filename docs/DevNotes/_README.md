# Purpose of this folder

The DevNotes folder exists purely as a place to quickly add some notes for personal usage during developemnt. They can be code snippets, best practices, minor TODOs or simply TILs. The format and the amount of detail provided may vary and in any case the target recipient is only myself, so the value of anything found in this folder for third parties may be none.
