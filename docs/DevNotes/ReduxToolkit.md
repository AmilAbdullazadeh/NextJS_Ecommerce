-   `configureStore` enables by default the integration with Redux DevTools extention and `thunks`.
-   `createSlice` seems like a great way to facilitate the implementation of the ducks structure pattern, allowing easy creation of state slices and sub-reducers.
-   `createSelector` is the preffered way to write selectors for my store.
