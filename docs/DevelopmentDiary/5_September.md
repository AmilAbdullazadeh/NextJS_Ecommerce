## 1 September 2021

I continue working on styling my footer component, but I just realized I am getting no typescript errors.

The component bellow is missing a mandatory prop `url` but VScode is not displaying any errors.

```tsx
interface LinkExternalProps {
    url: string;
    text: string;
}

const LinkExternal: React.FC<LinkExternalProps> = ({
    text,
}: LinkExternalProps) => <span>{text}</span>;

export default LinkExternal;
```

But this shows an error as it should

```tsx
interface LinkExternalProps {
    url: string;
    text: string;
}

const LinkExternal: React.FC<LinkExternalProps> = ({
    url,
    texts, //notice the extra 's'
}: LinkExternalProps) => <span>{texts}</span>;

export default LinkExternal;
```

There is also a weird problem with my `@components` path, which does not seem to work correctly, although I configured it exactly as all the others.

```json
//tsconfig.json
    "paths": {
      "@api": ["api"],
      "@components/*": ["components/*"],
      "@core/*": ["core/*"],
      "@hooks/*":["hooks/*"],
      "@store/*":["store/*"],
      "@styles":["styles"],
      "@testUtils": ["testUtils"],
      "@utils": ["utils"]
    },
```

```tsx
import { Typography } from '@components'; // Cannot find module '@components' or its corresponding type declarations
```

But this works

```json
//tsconfig.json
    "paths": {
      "@api": ["api"],
      "@components/*": ["components/"],// resolved path is missing the '*'
      "@core/*": ["core/*"],
      "@hooks/*":["hooks/*"],
      "@store/*":["store/*"],
      "@styles":["styles"],
      "@testUtils": ["testUtils"],
      "@utils": ["utils"]
    },
```

```tsx
import { Typography } from 'components'; // no '@', but the import works correctly
```

I suspect it has something to do with the fact that `@components/index.ts` exports multiple files.

```ts
export { default as Layout } from './Layout';
export { default as Typography } from '@material-ui/core/Typography';
export { default as NavBar } from './NavBar';
export { default as Footer } from './Footer';
```

because if I leave only one export statement then the `@` path works.

Oh my goooooooooooooood, the changes I was doing were correct, they were not taking effect because I had to restart the server jsnvlanjanvjanjienadsfngladfsg, the NextJS docs (https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) have a relevant note about that:

`Note: you need to restart dev server to reflect modifications done in tsconfig.json / jsconfig.json`.

this fixed the issue.

As a sidenote, am I spoiled for expecting import configuration settings to take effect while the dev server is running?

I could start working on the navigation bar element, but I want to take a break from creating elements and start implementing some SEO features.

Now, the list of things that needs to be implemented is quite long, but the first ones I want to add are structured data and head meta attributes. What I want to find out is the best way to get the dynamic data. Some pages are going to have their meta elements hardcoded, because they depend on the page, but some information is by nature dynamic (like json-ld data) so I want to find the best way to render them dynamically. I know there are 3 ways to do it:

-   `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
-   `react-helmet`
-   `next/head` (overriding the default head component of `NextJS`).

The first one was the go to option, that is if you knew what you were doing, the second one is a widely used solution and the third one is the way `NextJS` handles it. I feel inclined to start from the latter and work my way up the list if need be.

In the NextJS documentation (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head) it is adviced to use `next/script` instead of manually creating a `<script>` tag, however at the relevant documentation (https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/script) it is stated that `next/script must not be placed in either a next/head component or in pages/_document.js`. So basically it has to be appended to the body of the page, which does sound nice since for dynamic data I can access them with `getStaticProps `, although I guess since this is an ecommerce site and I need up to date data `getServerSideProps` would be the better option.

I checked the `og` tags from https://ogp.me/ and will check the `ld+json` ones from https://schema.org/.

Trying with the `Script` component does not yield results:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Script from 'next/script';

import { GIT_REPO_URL, SITE_NAME, SITE_URL } from '@core';

const StructuredDataScript: React.FC = () => {
    const JSON_LD = {
        '@context': 'http://schema.org',
        '@type': 'Organization',
        name: SITE_NAME,
        url: SITE_URL,
        sameAs: [GIT_REPO_URL],
    };

    return (
        <Script type="application/ld+json">{JSON.stringify(JSON_LD)}</Script>
    );
};

export default StructuredDataScript;

//Main.tsx

//...
return (
    <>
        <Head />
        <StructuredDataScript />
        <h1>PDP project</h1>
        <h2>{name}</h2>
        <h2 style={{ color: 'orange' }}>Hello World!!</h2>
        <h2>{loading ? 'loading' : 'finished loading'}</h2>
        <h2>{error && `error: ${error.message}`}</h2>
        <h2>server message: {data ? data.info : 'loading'}</h2>
    </>
);
```

The data are rendered on the page but are not present in page source.

BUT, there is a `strategy` prop and by setting it to `beforeInteractive` the script renders in page source, albeit escaped

```
<script src="" type="application/ld+json" defer="">{&quot;@context&quot;:&quot;http://schema.org&quot;,&quot;@...
```

Now, in order to prevent React from escaping the string it seems I have to... use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (I also checked out the advised-not-to-use `unescape` function mentioned at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/unescape but decided against using it for obvious reasons).

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import { GIT_REPO_URL, SITE_NAME, SITE_URL } from '@core';

const StructuredDataScript: React.FC = () => {
    const JSON_LD = {
        '@context': 'http://schema.org',
        '@type': 'Organization',
        name: SITE_NAME,
        url: SITE_URL,
        sameAs: [GIT_REPO_URL],
    };

    return (
        <script
            type="application/ld+json"
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(JSON_LD) }}
        ></script>
    );
};

export default StructuredDataScript;
```

After that the schema validator (https://validator.schema.org/) was able to correctly identify my structured data.

Now, I wondered if it was best to place the data at the `<head>` tag. It used to be that `<body>` was equally acceptable but in the "if you don't place it at the head you can also place it at the body of the document" kind of way, which while subtle, meant placing the data at the `<head>` was the better option.

But we want to be as professional as we resonably can here, so considering the W3 org specification for the `<head>` element (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/document-metadata.html#the-head-element) states that `The head element represents a collection of metadata for the Document` and since structured data are a textbook case of metadata, I will be adding them to the `<Head />` component of the page rather than its `<body />`.

Now, I got a bit carried away and added quite a few folders, files etc. The structure strategy I followed was that each component that needs components, defines a `components` folder which contains all the components the component (in this case the `Main` pages) needs

e.g

```
Main
    components
              Head
```

what about the `<StructuredDataScript />`? Strictly speaking, it is needed in `<Main />` but also strictly speaking, `<Main />` does not use it directly. In actuallity it is imported and subsequently used by `<Head />`. If I open the `Main/components` directory I expect to find components that are present in the return value of `<Main />`. With that in mind placing `<StructuredDataScript />` at the same level as `<Head />` seems hierarchically misguiding.

My solution was to define one more `components` directory

```
Main
    components
              Head
                   components
                              StructuredDataScript
```

Deeply nested, yes, but now it is evident that `<StructuredDataScript />` is a subcomponent (a _direct_ subcomponent) of `<Head />` and that is explicitly placed there. In turn, the same applies for the relationship between `<Head />` and `<Main />`,

This also allows me to futher break down the `<Head />` component in the future, maybe by creating separate components for `open graph` tags, `twitter cards` and other `meta tags`, if I choose to do so.

Of cource, I still do have the generic `components` folder under `/src` but I am opting to use this directory for the re-useable components. Anything that is strictly needed by only one component goes into said component's `components` directory and if in the future the same component is deemed necessary elsewhere, it will be refactored and exported from the generic `components` directory. This way the generic `components` directly trully only contains re-useable components and each `components` sub-folder only contains components needed by the specific component which contains them.

What is also important is to decide on how I will be handling the `ld+json` data. Right now the values in `Main` page are hardcoded and that is acceptable, they are not values that are expected to change dynamically. But the same is not the case for the `ld+json` data that will be added in future pages like `<Product />` or `<ProductsListing />` or `<Categories />`. Will I be creating page-specific versions of the `<StructuredDataScript />`? Do I need to consider a generic utility function that will generate the strings? https://json-ld.org/ has a list of available third party packages that I can use but I am hesitant adding dependencies (and thus affecting bundle size) for things that I can make myself with a reasonable degree of quality and useability. At the end of the day, shaving some kilobytes from my served application is expected to have a non-zero impact on the performance metrics.

Next I will resume working on the user interface, this time by creating the navigation bar element.

## 3 September 2021

I said I would continue with the navbar, but I thought I would read about accessibility a bit more, to make sure my footer component is up to par. Now, I know there are a lot of thing you have to implement to make sure your application is accessible (font scaling options, color-blind friendly palette, specific attributes for DOM elements to offer different way to access them) but the first thing I wanted to cover was aria roles (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA). I also would like to find a validator so that I can pinpoint areas of the application that need change. I will create an appopriately named file under `DevNotes/` directory to keep some notes about accessibility.

Reading the documentation, it seems that many aria roles are covered by HTML5 semantic tags (https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/#rule1), not sure about how much the first overlaps with the latter.

I did find two online validator tools:

-   https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php
-   https://wave.webaim.org/

For example, I get the error that the links in my `footer` element have low contrast with their background.

[45 minutes later]

Alright, so, basically, I straight up copied Amazon's color palette. Jeff forgive me.

Btw, a note on git workflows.

Right now, considering I move and break things a ton, I prefer to stick to my main branch and just be mindful about not doing (too many) "test" or "wip" commits. Under normal circumstances, tasks like "create the footer of the application" would be separate tasks, with separate acceptance criteria, descriptions and, most importantly, git branches and merge requests. I plan to introduce git workflows in the project at a later stage, when the application has a stable release version so any additional feature (something defined as "extra milestone" for example) will be a "new" feature when compared to the initial scope. Until then, working with git workflows will probably prove detrimental to my development experience and time management. I will, however, add a "define git workflow policy" in my TODO list.

I improved my footer element's style, updated my palette and typography defaults and added the `<CssBaseline />` component from `material-ui` to normalize my CSS.

Next, I noticed that my content is not scrollable, so I should continue from there (maybe also check out this: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/sticky-footer-navbar/).

## 4 September 2021

I made the navbar and the footer fixed, and added min height and margin-bottom to the body element to make my main content scrollable.

todo: make it more tidy, maybe move the margin-bottom from body to main, maybe add margin top, investigate the `margin: spacing(8, 0),` and if it's good to be there. Ideally body should have top / bottom margin equal to the height of the navbar / footer elements + something for styling reasons.

[done]

Now I want to start working on the navbar element, which is one of the most important ones. My current plan is to merge the "app bar" and "drawer" examples from the material ui docs (https://material-ui.com/components/app-bar/ and https://material-ui.com/components/drawers/ respectively) to create a navigaton bar wth a primary search field and a button that opens a sidedrawer. The sidedrawer will contain my navigation menu. I would also like to have more than one levels in the menu, each level covering the previous menu display when clicked, so that if a user navigates to a deep level they will continue to see just one navigation window and not an ever expanding sequense of them.

I implemented the toggle functionality and refactored the side menu with some text and icons. I only added one category, technology, alongside some subcategories. I will most probably refactor this section in the future depending on the products and categories I decided to display, but for now it's alright.

## 6 September 2021

I am going to write a couple of tests for my sidemenu component then probably work on further styling the navigation bar.

I am trying to use RTL to find a button. I want to use the `name` property by the library notes it's deprecated. The same comment provides no information about what I should use instead and the official documentation still uses the `name` property. It's on of those days I suppose.

Regarding the navbar element I will be using `grid` to align the different elements (the logo/text, the search field, possible additional buttons on the far right). I could do it with material-ui's `<Grid />` component, but I will try to make it with the css `grid` rule, which I have never used in the past and is a primary goal of this project, as defined in the `TODO` document.

I styled the navigation bar with a menu icon (the classc humburger one) and a search icon, using css grid. As a sidenote, if I didn't have (as per the initially set requirements) to do it with css grid, I would most definitely use material-ui's `<Grid />` component, especially for more complex grids (an option I would like to reserve for the future if the use case demmands it).

Now, while I work on the `<Search />` component, the next thinkg I will be doing is add a dedicated `api` sub-directory to handle the "search product" query and subsequent data / no data results. This means jumping back in the server and addding the relevant query and query resolver. After that I will also have to write the tests.

## 7 September 2021

I refactored the server files to have a central `products` folder that contains all the product directories (so again, a by-feature architecture pattern like ducks) and created a `union` named `Product` that is either of the actual products. This also meant I had to add some unique per product props so that the `__resolveType` function could differentiate them.

Btw, how life saving is that server introspection script now huh?

In the scope of implementing the search product functionality I will create a `useDebounce` hook with a standard 500ms delay to handle user input then query the server.

I encountered a weird problem where the graphql call was successful but I was getting empty objects in my react component (although the network tab was showing correct values). After some searching it turns out this was caused because I was quering for a union type and I had to also include `__typename` in my query results so that apollo could make sense of the returned `type` during runtime.

Now, let's take a lookat my `graphql` query:

```ts
import { gql } from '@apollo/client';

export const GET_PRODUCT_BY_NAME = gql`
    query getProductByName($name: String!) {
        getProductByName(name: $name) {
            __typename
            ... on Phone {
                name
                image
                price
                url
            }
            ... on Tablet {
                name
                image
                price
                url
            }
        }
    }
`;
```

what happens with a structure like this is that my data return with the following structure:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "getProductByName": {
            "__typename": "Phone",
            "url": "https://rhiannon.name",
            "price": 97,
            "name": "recusandae"
        }
    }
}
```

and this means I have to access them by accessing the `getProductByName` property.

```ts
useEffect(() => {
    data &&
        data.getProductByName.forEach(({ name }: { name: string }) =>
            console.log('product found:', name)
        );
}, [data]);
```

This is ugly right?

Digging around it seems that `getProductByName` **is not** a query name, but rather a regular field on the root query type `Query` and that having results on the exact same shape as the query is one of the core design principles of GraphQL (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45238631/any-reason-i-am-getting-back-the-query-name-in-the-graphql-results).

This explains the format of my `gql` queries. I create a `query` of name whatever (but this time, of name `getProductByName`), which calls the `getProductByName` query that I have actually declared on my server.

If I need the returned values to be under `products` I would have to change my schema definition from this:

```ts
const ProductTypeDef = gql`
    union Product = Phone | Tablet

    extend type Query {
        "Returns products that include the input name in their name"
        getProductByName(name: String!): [Product]
    }
`;
```

to this:

```ts
const ProductTypeDef = gql`
    union Product = Phone | Tablet

    extend type Query {
        "Returns products that include the input name in their name"
        products(name: String!): [Product]
    }
`;
```

I think I should change my schema to be more generic (this feels very `REST` like). What I want to find before that is if I will be polluting the name space. For example, I may want a `products` query that has only the name as an input param but also another `products` that will maybe have a price range too. Should I create a general one? Can I declare two and make the server differentiate them somehow?

That being said, I feel that defining a single query and playing around with default args to customize the resolver based on the number and type of provided arguments leans a bit on the back end side of things.

In any case, I renamed my queries to be more GraphQL-like (for example renamed `getProductById` to simply `product`).

Now, since I can fetch data on my search bar, I need to display them. This means displaying a list with the returned products as links, each one directing the user to it's assocciated product details page. This means that my mock data can not be randomly generated (at least not all of them), since at the very least I need the image urls to be specific, so that I can actually serve them from my `static` folder. I think this is what I should do next, especially since what's left to finish the landing page is displaying a bunch of products / categories on the front page, and this needs some properties of my generated data to be the specific.

So, I need to find some random phone / tablet images (or a single one) and create a not-so-random mock generator function for these two products.

## 8 September 2021

Found out I could alias the result of my graphQL query

```ts
export const GET_PRODUCT_BY_NAME = gql`
    query getProductsByName($name: String!) {
        results: products(name: $name) { // notice the alias results here
            __typename
            ... on Phone {
                name
                image
                price
                url
            }
            ... on Tablet {
                name
                image
                price
                url
            }
        }
    }
`;
```

impostor syndrome intesifies.

Generally speaking, the search component needs only to display its results and can be considered ready. That being said, this consideration can only be done in the context of the scope of this project. What I am going to do is grab the first 5 results and display them. What happens if the results are more than 5? What happens if they are 30? Or 50? In a production setting I would add a "see more" on the bottom of the result mini list and then navigate the user to a dedicated "search page" where they will be able to see all the results of their query. I am not going to do that, since it would only add to the initially specified scope of the project, a scope that so far has only expanded.

I add this note to indicate that while "done", the component will not be "optimal" or close to what I consider "optimal". This is in order to rein a bit on the developement effort and to try to reach the (self imposed) deadline of December 1st. I will however add this note as an entry under "maybe" in the TODO list.

Now I think I will be using material-ui's `Autocomplete` component to implement the dropdown I have in mind, replacing the current input base I am using.

[later]

Tried setting something up but I was too tired, messed it up, reverted everything but some minor clean up changes and called it a day.

## 11 September 2021

Ideally I would like to finish with the autocomplete component today. Since I don't really have a clear implementation in mind (desing-wise) I will work in a separate branch. I decided that since I have the styling ready I can use the headless variation of the `Autocomplete` component, the problem is enforcing a consistent typing, since my autocomplete input can be `string`, `null` or `SearchOption` where the latter is the type of the data that the query returns `type SearchOption = Pick<ApiProduct, 'name' | 'image' | 'price' | 'url'>;`.

In the end, I was baited by the component's `onChange` prop. What I actually needed was `onInputChange` to specifically target user input (which is always string) and not user's selection (which is `string`, `null` or `Option`).

With that change I am able to retain my search bar's style as well as display possible results. Now I need to style the list and also fix a problem where an `<li />` key is not unique (caused by me assigning the product name to it and the server actually generating non-unique product names, which is acceptable in the scope of a real world scenario).

Regarding the generation of unique ids, I know I can use lodash, a uuid library or native javascript code. Regarding the latter I know you can implement an `rfc4122` compliant string but you have to rely on the poor entropy of `Math.random`. On the other hand I remember reading about generating a uuid by leveraging a native javascript function, but can't really remember details. I remember you were creating "something" and that something had a prop which had to be implemented in a specific way that made it `rfc4122` compliant. In any case, I can just also retrieve the `id` property of the `Product` and be done with it, especially since I already generate it as a `uuid`.

Now I could create a new component that will receive the products fetched by the query and display them in a nice manner (I am thinking of small cards, with images and whatnot), or display the `error` and `loading` states but I am checking amazon's implementation and they just display the options. I think it's a clean approach and it will definitely save development time, so I will just style a bit the existing component to better display the results

I updated the styles to use my existing color palette and now I have to turn the search results into clickable hyperlinks to the product details page, plus to handle the `loading` and `error` states of the query call. Then, I should perform a clean up by moving the `material-ui` components that I am currently importing from the library inside my `components` folder. This will allow me to compress all the different "component" imports into a single import line and also will loosely define the components currently in use by my codebase. The latter seems strict but it's actually not. It exists so that a possible collaborator in the application will have a quick reference of the components we use to create the UI. If said person needs another `material-ui` not currently in use, they can just add it to the `components` folder exports and carry on. This is to avoid directly importing `material-ui` components in other components, consolidating the exports to a single point of reference, allowing me greater flexility in the future to replace a `material-ui` component I don't like with another custom or third party one. It also loosely enforces the usage of specific components, which allows a certain degree of design cohesiveness (meaning, if `material-ui` exports an `<UnecessaryComponent />` that doesn't mean it can be used just because it's available. Maybe the same UI can be achieved with some other components already available, this makes development more structured since all the developers work with the same set of components, which contains less than the total available components provided by the library). But again, just to stress it out, if someone needs another `material-ui` not currently in use, they can just add it to the `components` folder exports and carry on.

Quick update on that, there seems to be a problem when dynamically using a component exported like that, in cases for example that I render a list when a fetch call is finished, the UI is broken (I am guessing it's an issue with styling not dynamically applying to the components that were not used until now or something similar). I moved the imports inside the components again for some of them.

I should also consider adding a toast notification for failed calls or success messages, preferrably in a centralized way. Added it to the "maybe" list (just thinking it should be a fun integration with `redux-saga`).

Now the only thing left is to add some tests and the MR should be finished.

Also, just realized the `url` property in my products is not needed, since the pages are dynamically created via the `id` prop.

To do tomorrow: finish test, consider adding toastify.

## 12 September 2021

I spent two hours trying to test the search autocomplete functionality. For a while I thought the problem was that my DOM selectors were wrong, but in the end the problem was that my mock graphql call did not include any "variables". I thought if you mocked the results you did not have to be explicit (or include in any capacity) the query variables but it seems they have to be sent as well, probably because the query fails on a declaration level.

After writing the test I removed some redundant types from my query, since I only need `name` and `id` in my results (and `__typename` of course).

I considered adding `react-toastify` which I had used in the past. The plan would be to leverage its customization options to replace the default rendered component with `<Alert />` from `material-ui` but this would take some time to get right and would add to the TODO list, which I am trying to keep under control. If I need notifications I can consider using `<Alert />` in a specific part of the page and trigger it via `redux` or go with `react-toastify` + `<Alert />`. For the time being I have to keep my deadline in mind. I have already updated the `maybe` section of my TODO list to reconsider this feature implementation in the future, should time and energy allows it. For now, the `<Search />` component is done.

Just for the fun of it, I added a github workflow to run my jest tests when trying to merge a pull request. There is also a repository setting to enforce the pipeline be completed without errors before merging the MR (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58654530/how-to-reject-a-pull-request-if-tests-are-failed-github-actions) but unfortunately I have to make the repository public, which is something I would like to avoid until I finish the whole thing.

On to my next task: create a "product" card to display various different products and their information in the main page, create the relevant query, display them in the main section of the `Main` page, pay attention to using semantic HTML5 tags (image / figure, section, article, details) and make sure the grid is responsive for all screen sizes. Doing this will basically complete the `Main` page of the application.

## 13 September 2021

Continuing from yesterday, I will mess around in a codebox with material-ui's `<Card />` component (https://material-ui.com/components/cards/). What I have in mind is a fairly simple card: product image, followed by product name, rating (the good old stars of vayring fullness) and price, with the product name being a link to the product details page. I will work with an online image (absolute url of an online resource) then once the component is ready will substitute it with dynamic images. This will be a good time to check next-gen image formats (a valuable SEO metric which also cuts down on user's bandwidth usage) and things like lazy loading (with intersection observer api).

Now, it bears saying that in a full professional environemnt I would consider implementing the card as a purely presentational component and have all its bussiness logic (update rating, add to cart, add to wishlist, add to compare page etc) extracted into a custom hook. Usually an ecommerce site has more than one type of "card". You have the giant "jumbotron" ones, the "normal" ones which you can find in the landing or category pages, maybe you have some small ones to use in your mini-cart or checkout page, there is a certain degree of variation. Extracting the bussiness logic in a custom hook allows the separation between UI and bussiness, thus giving me the freedom to implement different UI representations of the product which all share the same underlying logic.

In my application I will be using the "normal" kind and one more at most for the mini cart, so two in total, so I will be skipping the custom hook approach.

I should also check how to add multiple products to my structured data.

## 14 September 2021

Not much time to work today, just want to squeeze some work before hitting the bed, mainly go throught the todo comments in my ProductCard component and make sure the final result is nice and clean. This is _the_ most important component of the application.

Working with styling my latest ordeal is trying to import the product image. It is hilarious that the top google result is a stackoverflow question with the accepted answer being

```tsx
import mainLogo from './logoWhite.png';
```

and then a comment saying "just use create react app". Ok, but what happens if I want to know how to do it myself?

I styled the product cart for the mobile view (this _is_ a mobile first application after all) and added `next/image` which does come with lazy loading and next gen image format, which is nice. I do wonder though if I need to ditch the `image` property of my product and just use their `id` to dynamically load the corresponding images from my `public` folder.

Next: I have to read about adding structured data for the displayed products to my page's head, decide what to do with the images (also, organize them in sub-directories), style the non-mobile viewport product card and use server's data to populate the card component.

## 15 September 2021

I do fear these back to back entries tend to lose flavour and degrade to "style this, add this call, finish". In any case. I need to finish styling the card (desktop) and add calls.

Regarding the dynamic name of the images, I decided to use the existing `image` prop which is of type `string` and just append it to the path. In an enterprise setting I would have a CMS feeding the app with such things (absolute urls for the images and then serve them from another content server for example) so no reason to complicate things. So I just need to create 7-8 phones and serve them as mocks.

Added hardcoded phones, placed them in a flexbox. My current problem is varying card height due to different text heights, even though I previously added css to truncate it if too long.

Or did I? I can see the css code but it seems I did not add the class to my JSX? This is weird.

I re-added the class and now my product cards are consistent.

Next: Handle "error" and "loading" states for main page (at least, not sure about search bar, this is a nice opportunity to use material-ui's `<Alert />` component), check structured data about the products, write some header text for the section and test markup with the tools I mentioned earlier. Then style for desktop and repeat the checks.

## 18 September 2021

Picking up from where I left, I added handlers for the `loading` and `error` states of my "phones" landing page call and a loading spinner. I contemplated extracting the spinner in a seperate component that also uses grid to place the spinner at the center, but in the future I may need to add the spinner in places where being centered is not the correct decision.

Now, I need to add structured data for my front page products. After a bit of searching `ProdudctCollection` (https://schema.org/ProductCollection) seems the most reasonable choice. This structure should be part of the pre-rendered html, so that means that fetching them via the hooks exposed by Apollo is a mistake. Since the current scenario is a page that needs to be generally static, but with dynamic content it's the text book case for using `getStaticProps` (https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).

Having huuuuge trouble getting `getStaticProps` to work with `apollo`. Going through the documentation I can find some examples with big chunks of code but no sufficient explanation what purpose the code serves. Also, I think it is a more complex topic than I initially anticipated that may require multiple changes and additions (the examples I see use deep merge functions from third party libraries) so I should probably work in a new branch so that I can go wild with changes and wip commits.

At the very least I think this should work

```ts
export const getStaticProps = async () => {
    return {
        props: { topSellingPhones: [] },
    };
};
```

But it doesn't.

I am expecting an empty array but I still get `undefined`. This indicates a configuration error on my part somewhere in the app. There is a good chance this error is at `_app.tsx`. Will have to check.

## 19 September 2021

Tried getting `getStaticProps` to work with no success.

## 20 September 2021

Tried getting `getStaticProps` to work with no success. At this point I have read many different stack overflow posts, medium articles and the official `NextJS` documentation. I still believe I am missing something elementary and that there is a good chance it lies in `_app.tsx`. Created a stack overflow question to get some help which can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69248001/nextjs-getstaticprops-is-not-getting-called.

## 21 September 2021

I was able to solve my issue. The culprit was my `index.ts` file. `NextJS` searches for the `getStaticProps` function in `pages`, that is files with the `js,jsx,tsx` extentions under `pages` directory. My `index.ts` file was exporting my `Main.tsx` component as it was, meaning `export { default } from './Main'`. I assumed the "new" page was the `Main.tsx` component, but the actual page was the `index.ts` file all along, meaning the `Main.tsx` was considered a component of the page and not the page itself. `NextJS` was searching for `getStaticProps` in my `index.ts` file (which did not declare it) and was ignoring the one declared inside `Main.tsx`.

I changed `index.ts` to `index.tsx` and made it so it immediately renders the `<Main />` component

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next';

import { client } from '@api';

import Main, { MainProps } from './Main';
import { GET_FRONT_PAGE_PHONES } from './Main/api';

const Index: React.FC<MainProps> = (props: MainProps) => <Main {...props} />;

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
    const { data: frontPagePhones } = await client.query({
        query: GET_FRONT_PAGE_PHONES,
    });

    return {
        props: {
            frontPagePhones,
        },
    };
};

export default Index;
```

and it worked.

This was also mentioned in a comment in my stack overflow question where a user asked if I was really declaring the function inside a page and not inside a component. I created a temporary page in a `Temp.tsx` file that I placed immediately under `pages` directory and inside it `getStaticProps` was working correctly. When I added it as an export inside `pages/index.ts` I got a `NextJS` error that it was a component and not a page and this lead me back to the `NextJS` documentation where it was stated that for the landing page the `index` file was considered _the_ page, so everything inside it was but a component.

This does mean that for every `page` that is somewhat complex and requires sub-directories I will have to create an `index` file to render the "actual main" page component. This did make me worry that if an error occurs in the future I will not be able to identify which of the "index" files caused it, but then again, the fact that only the "pages" main files will be named as such _and_ contain code means that at any given point in time only a single "index" file with code will be loaded, the one corresponding to the current page, so this should solve the aforementioned problem.

I added a new type of `ld+json` structured data, of type `ProductCollection` (https://schema.org/ProductCollection) to denote the landing page offers. In a real world scenario I would have a single request for the "top sellers" by category and the split them depending on their product category then use multiple times the same `ProductCollection` component to adds multiple structured data entries with dynamic values for each product category. For the purpose of this exercice project a single category is enough (the scalability option is still present, one would just need to implement the fetching, which would be a general query for `Product` type products, like the union query present in the `Search` component).

Added tests for the product card.

Now I need to style the desktop version of the product cards, maybe add a jumbotron of such sorts above them and I am ready to move to the product details page.

To consider: create an "image with fallback" component incase the image src is unavailable. This answer has a nice implementation but I got some problems getting the typings correct (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66949606/what-is-the-best-way-to-have-a-fallback-image-in-nextjs).

[10 minutes later]

Alright, I was a bit tired and in my need to "get it done before going to bed" I was hasty (I should not be, this is not a race, I just like going to bed without letting things unfinished). I went through the documentation and checked the props and had the revelation that "StaticImport" type boiled down to "a valid path under static folder". Thus, I was able to type the component and test that it actually shows the fallback image.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Image from 'next/image';

interface ImageFallbackProps {
    src: string;
    fallbackSrc: string;
    alt: string;
    width: number;
    height: number;
}

const ImageFallback: React.FC<ImageFallbackProps> = ({
    src,
    fallbackSrc,
    alt,
    width,
    height,
}: ImageFallbackProps) => {
    const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(false);
    const [oldSrc, setOldSrc] = useState(src);

    const handleImgSrcError = () => setImgSrc(true);

    if (oldSrc !== src) {
        setImgSrc(false);
        setOldSrc(src);
    }

    return (
        <Image
            src={imgSrc ? `/images/${fallbackSrc}` : `/images/${src}`}
            alt={alt}
            layout="responsive"
            width={width}
            height={height}
            onError={handleImgSrcError}
        />
    );
};

export default ImageFallback;
```

Two notes:

-   I have to hardcode the `layout="responsive"` property. Depending on the `layout` value the `width` and `height` properties should not be present. Going through the hoops to make `ImageFallbackProps` component "smart enough" seems unnecessary considering `responsive` as a value covers my use cases.
-   I did not include an "it renders fallback image on img src error" in my `ProductCard.test.tsx` file. `NextJS` uses (I think) base64 strings as image paths and I have no idea how to verify that the base64 representation of the image src I am getting is the expected one, nor I think I should try to do so.

I extracted the new component into its own directory under the project widh `components` directory, with the assumption that it is general enough to be considered as the one to use everywhere.

So as I said earlier: Now I need to style the desktop version of the product cards, maybe add a jumbotron of some sorts above them and I am ready to move to the product details page.

## 22 September 2021

I added a new prop `imageFallback` to the `ProductCard` component to make it more generic (previously I hardcoded the fall back image src inside it).

Started working on the desktop style of the product cards, what's left is to make the images a bit smaller for bigger screens and investigate why my `<main />` has a max width even on large screens.

[5 mins later]

It was caused by the `material-ui` container component I was using in a wrong way. It had a "maxWidth" prop that by default was set to "lg" but what I actually needed was to set it to false explicitly to make the container fluid.

So far in the project quite a few hiccups can be boiled down to "make sure you read the documentation and understand exactly what it is that you are using before you do use it".

## 23 September 2021

In the previous days I have been using material-ui's `Box` component in conjunction with external `.styles.ts` files. This is not something that I normally do. I prefer a singular styling approach and `Box` breaks it because it introduces inline styling, whereas up until now all the styles are defined in external files. The component's wide array of properties makes it very useful as a generic (or specialized) container. I have not used it before so this is the reason I opted to use it alongside external style files. In a real world scenario I would probably discuss it with my team and try to establish a usage pattern. Maybe only style on `Box` if it's paddings or margins to leverage the spacing properties? Only use it as a container instead of `div` tags? In the context of this project I use it to see how it turns out and how well it plays with my existing styling architecture.

Started working on my `Jumbotron` component and noticed that I kind of disliked the footer and then I realized it had `fixed` position, so it was always at the bottom of my screen, whereas I wanted it to appear only when I scrolled to the end of the page.

I changed the position to absolute, changed the containing `React.Fragment` of the `Layout` to `Box` with `position` set to `relative` and set the height of `body` to `100vh` and now the footer was working as intended.

I removed the `getServerInfo` query from the `Main` page. It existed so I could test how `useQuery` functions, now that I am close to finishing the styling of the landing page it should be removed.

## 24 September 2021 (early morning)

I fixed some markup errors indicated by the W3C validation rule and updated my error color to increase its contrast in accordance to the WAVE inspection tool I use. The last two things to fix (mark up wise) in the main page is an error caused by the usage of `box-orient` property (which is not standard and thus not recommended for production, firefox why you do this to me) and a warning about the lack of heading tags in my product cards (which are wrapped in `article` tags). The reason I am using `box-orient` is in order to achieve truncating the last line of a multi-line text if it's too long. I _should_ do it in a standard way though.

Next:

-   achieve the same truncation result with a standard implementation, see https://css-tricks.com/line-clampin/ for some approaches.
-   add an `h4` heading tag to the product cards and change the existing `h4` tags at the footer component to `h5`.

## 24 September 2021

I fixed the `box-orient` warning by replacing the property name with `-webkit-box-orient` and made the name part of the product card description to be an `h4` header tag with `display` set to `inline` so that is does not force a line break. I also changed the footer tags from `h4` to `h5` to better streamline my heading tags flow.

The `https://validator.w3.org/` markup validation tool finds zero errors and / or warnings and the `WAVE` accessibility evaluation tool finds zero errors. I do get two warnings caused by `NextJS` injecting two `noscript` elements but considering that they are injected by the framework and that they don't actually contain anything (and I certainly don't use them for anything) the UI is not affected and neither does the user's experience.

And with this change, I can consider the landing page of the application officially **completed**.

## 25 September 2021

Today I will start working on the product page of the application. I already have the `layout` ready so that means I will only need to add the `main` of the page. Design wise what I have in mind is an image of the phone, description on the right (beneath for mobile view) and an "add to cart" button (disabled if product stock is zero). Add to cart button does mean that I will also work in the mini cart of the application, something for which I am stocked since it means finally getting to work more with redux-saga and redux toolkit. Oh, plus breacrumb and related SEO and structured data metadata.

First of all, I need to have a dynamic route (https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).

Getting typescript errors on my `getStaticPaths` function even though I followed the documentation to the letter.

```tsx
export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-magic-numbers
    const IDs = await [1, 2, 3];

    const paths = IDs.map(id => ({
        params: { id },
    }));

    return { paths, fallback: false };
};
```

The error I am getting is `Type '() => Promise<{ paths: { params: { id: number; }; }[]; fallback: false; }>' is not assignable to type 'GetStaticPaths<ParsedUrlQuery>'` which indicates that `getStaticPaths` needs a bit more typing information whichis weird since the documentation (https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#typescript-use-getstaticpaths) is really straighforward in what it describes:

```tsx
import { GetStaticPaths } from 'next';

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
    // ...
};
```

This is also the indicated way described in https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript#static-generation-and-server-side-rendering.

[5 minutes later]

Alright, so, _mea culpa_, I was passing numbers as object props and that was not cool on my part. Typescript was complaining because `GetStaticPaths` is an object or a `promise` for an object with property names of type `string` and I was passing numbers which is not even valid javascript.

Managed to get a working proof of concept:

```tsx
export interface ProductProps {
    name: string;
    id: string;
}

export const Product: React.FC<ProductProps> = ({ name, id }: ProductProps) => {
    console.log('products');

    return (
        <span>
            this is the product page for product {name} with id: {id}
        </span>
    );
};

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
    const { id } = params; // this shows an error
    //fetch product by params.id
    const product: ProductProps = await { name: 'product one', id: '1' };

    return {
        props: {
            name: product.name,
            id: product.id,
        },
    };
};

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
    const paths = await ['1', '2', '3'].map(id => ({
        params: { id },
    }));

    return { paths, fallback: false };
};

export default Product;
```

Now, normally the `id` inside `params` in `getStaticProps` would be used to fetch each specific product based on the generated path by `getStaticPaths`, however here I was getting the error that `Property 'id' does not exist on type 'ParsedUrlQuery | undefined'` which makes sense because in this file I expect my params to include an `id` property, coming from `getStaticPaths` but `ParsedUrlQuery` does not contain such a property. The solution was to extend `ParsedUrlQuery`.

```tsx
// ...
import { ParsedUrlQuery } from 'querystring';

interface ProductPageParams extends ParsedUrlQuery {
    id: string;
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
    const { id } = params as ProductPageParams;
    //fetch product by params.id
    const product: ProductProps = await { name: `product ${id}`, id };

    return {
        props: {
            name: product.name,
            id: product.id,
        },
    };
};

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
    const paths = await ['1', '2', '3'].map(id => ({
        params: { id },
    }));

    return { paths, fallback: false };
};
```

The names should probably change, but the solution is working and I get no errors in my IDE.

Started working on a query that would return all `Product` ids but then reverted my changes. I realized I already have a `getAllProducts` query that returns all products, which I could use to just request for the `id` property. This is exactly the type of power `GraphQL` offers me, so no reason to polute the codebase with an unnecessary query that goes against `GraphQL`'s paradigm.

I set up the query and replaced the statics results with "real" mock data coming from my server. Now, before continuing with styling the product details page I should also create one additional product in my `MOCK_PHONES` array that will correspond to the one on my `Jumbotron`: the iPhone 13 Pro (oh, so, pro).

## 26 September 2021

Broke my self made promise and worked a bit more on the main page of the application, just so I could render a different application name for small viewports, so that it can be used as the "navigate to home" button.

I tried writing a test for different viewports and the amount of custom hackery I encountered was daunting. All the solutions proposed overwritting the `window.resize` function so that I could fire it from inside my `jest` tests after setting `env` to `jsdom` in the command line. Cherry on the top was RTL's `fireEvent.resize` second param being `options?: {} | undefined` which provided absolutely no help at all.

At the end of the day testing different viewports is a super common need for web applications and I feel it is not easy to do so _at all_. It really should be its own section in the official documentation for `jest` and `react-testing-library` but here I am going over custom hacks and window property overrides at stack overflow.

In the course of this project I don't think there was another day like this where I actually wrote code and nevertheless felt I made so little progress.

[later in the day]

I added some styles and grids to the product details page as well the "add to cart" and "buy now" buttons. I also found out an error in the urls that were generated in the `Search` component (it was linking to `product/{id}` instead of `products/{id}`) and I thought this was a good chance to add some url constructors to the `core` folder.

```ts
export const productDetailsPage: (id: string) => string = id =>
    `/products/${encodeURIComponent(id)}`;
```

so that this

```tsx
<Link href={`/products/${encodeURIComponent(option.id)}`}>
    <a className={classes.searchOption}>{option.name}</a>
</Link>
```

can now be written as

```tsx
<Link href={productDetailsPage(option.id)}>
    <a className={classes.searchOption}>{option.name}</a>
</Link>
```

which not only is easier to read but also makes sure I will not mistype any URL like I previously did.

Of course, this does mean that this

```tsx
<Link href="/">landing page</Link>
```

had to be rewritten like this

```tsx
<Link href={landingPage()}>landing page</Link>
```

This is one of those cases where consistency in following a guideline forces a change that may seem silly, but it's better to be consistent across the codebase than taking the short path and leaving something as it was because it seems simple.

I added tests for the `Actions` component and called it a day.

## 27 September 2021

I extracted the product rating into a separate component and made `@components` folder `index` file more consistent by having it export named exports instead of "default as `<something>`".

## 28 September 2021

I styled the product details page for all viewports. Next I plan to add head, page title, head and open grapth metadata.

## 29 September 2021

I realized that the existence of an `index` file within my `Main` folder meant that a `/Main` route existed in my app, which was unintended and to make things worse it also returned an error (since it was exporting the `Main` component but without getting any props from the `src/pages/index.tsx` file). I removed the file and made it so the landing page `index` file under `/src/pages` was importing the `Main` component and its props directly from the respective file and not via an `index` file and the `/Main` page was no more.

[later]

It seems that everything under `/pages` is considered a valid url. So `/products/components/Actions/Actions` actually returns the `Actions` component. This is a major design flaw and I should immediately focus my attention on fixing it by updating the folder structure so I will suspend working on the product details page. The timing is also favourable since I just finished re-designing its grid system.

I found out that `NextJS` supports an indication of which type of files should be considered as "pages" via a configuration called `custom page extentions` in `next.config.js` (a configuration file I did not have up until that point). This is super useful and just what I needed (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/custom-page-extensions).

```js
/**
 * @type {import('next').NextConfig}
 */
const nextConfig = {
    /* config options here */
    pageExtensions: ['page.tsx', 'page.ts'],
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

_next.config.js_

```js
    "env": {
        //...
        "node": true
    },
```

_.eslintrc_

After this configuration only files `page.tsx` or `page.ts` are used as pages (and routes). This also meant I was able to re-introduce my `Main/index.ts` file without fear that it will be considered a page.

I added the `head` element and the relevant metadata for the product details page as well as some url constructors that were needed in order to eliminate hardcoded url paths from the codebase.

I also changed `/pages/Main` to `/pages/main`. Little fun tip: git does not detect changes in capitalization. In order to force an update I first changed `/pages/Main` to `/pages/main_`, then commited the change and immediately after removed the underscore, so the end result was `/pages/main`.

## 30 September 2021

I extracted the main body of my product details page in a separate file, much like what I did with the landing page. This way I can have my `.page.tsx` files be simple components that call `NextJS` functions like `getStaticProps` and immediately pass them to the actual component that I want to render. This also means the main component is now easier to test since the outer logic layer (which is what the library exposes) has been removed from it.

While adding more tests an interesting case came along, my `Main.test.tsx` file was missing coverage for the `Alert` component:

```tsx
// ...
{
    !frontPagePhones && (
        <Alert severity="error">Error fetching top selling phones</Alert>
    );
}
// ...
```

How do I test this? But of course by setting `frontPagePhones` to undefined. But I can't, because I myself do not allow it in my code:

```tsx
export interface MainProps {
    frontPagePhones: PhoneData;
}
```

_`frontPagePhones` can never be `undefined` inside my test file because the typing does not allow it_

but of course this makes no sense, if the request fails for whatever reason I will be getting `undefined`, so I _should_ accomodate for such a scenario and I did just that by changing the prop type to optional.

This is an interesting case where the need to increase my test coverage lead me to writing tests for uncovered cases and the latter revealed a logical error in my types. A failed request means I am getting `undefined`, not zero results. Of course, what are the chances an ecommerce technology shop has zero mobile phones to sell? I could very well treat the zero results as an error, but it would not be strictly correct, since the request itself would not have failed (but maybe someone misconfigured the CMS). In cases like this maybe a PO could indicate that I should treat no results as an error case, but since I am the one making these decisions I will handle it separately.

Today was all about cleanup, tidying up and meeting test coverage goals so a really satisfactory session from start to finish.

Next, I will be reading the `redux-toolkit` docs to check the best way to add state slices to my application and maybe about making app state persistent. The goal is to create the mini cart component and its underlying logic, most probably in a hook.
