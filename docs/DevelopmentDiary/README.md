# Diary

I will try to maintain a developement diary of my efforts and way of thinking in order to have logs of the development proccess. The entries will be top level and will not go into (too much) technical detail for ease of navigation and reading. Any tech specific decision will be covered in the `docs/ADRs` section of the project. The diary aims to keep a log of the ongoing development.
